This project is a simulation of animal behaviour on the Rossumøya. The Island has four different kins of landscape, 
lowland, highland, dessert and water. The difference between the landscapes is how much fodder
that is available and if the animals have the possibility's to move to them.
On the island it only lives two species, herbivores and carnivores. The biggest difference between them
are that herbivores only eats fodder in the landscape and carnivores only eats other herbivores.
One year on Rossumøya is broken down in to six periods. First, all the animals are going to eat, first the herbivores 
the carnivores. The deciding factor for which animals are going to eat is their fitness attribute.
Second, all the animals have the possibility to give birth if more than one animal are on the same cell.
Third, the animals have the possibility to move to a connected cell vertical or horizontal, but they
can only move to one cell each season. Fourth, the animals get one year older. Fifth, all the animals
loses a bit of their weight. Sixth, some animals are going to die of natural causes. 

In this project it does exist one directory with the source code, one directory for all the tests, two directories 
with different examples and a directory to save the result.
